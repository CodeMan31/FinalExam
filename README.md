This demonstration shows a python program accepting voice input from my webcam and sending a command to an adruion to control the stae of an LED. At one point, what I say is not understood by the program and you can see "WHAT?" being output to the console

Part 2

This demostartion shows a python program recognizing the faces of me and my roommate Jack. You can also see that it for a split second calls Jack Justin. I believe this is because there were less images of him used by the trainer. I added some extra images for myself but all of the images of him were taken by the picturetaker program
